### GTA V Casino Solver

#### Disclaimer:
This is probably considered 3rd party tools by R* so it is against their Eula, but the way this script works is by watching the screen and comparing it to the screenshots in the folders, it doesn't tamper with in-game memory or does it input any commands, so R* has no way to detect it, it just sees the correct fingerprints and places a tooltip in front of it, **it is very safe.**

#### Usage:
Works only on Windows platform.
