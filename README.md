### GTA V Casino Solver

#### Disclaimer:
This is probably considered 3rd party tools by R* so it is against their Eula, but the way this script works is by watching the screen and comparing it to the screenshots in the folders, it doesn't tamper with in-game memory or does it input any commands, so R* has no way to detect it, it just sees the correct fingerprints and places a tooltip in front of it, **it is very safe.**

#### Usage:
1. Download and install Autohotkey.

2. Gta must be running in borderless window mode and ingame resolution must be the same as desktop (VERY IMPORTANT).

3. I only tested this in my machine so your results may vary, also i think i know why many of you are having issues, some ingame assets dont scale well at some resolutions (doesnt seem to happen at 1920x1080 for example) which means that if a keypad button looks one way when its at a certain set of coordinates it will look slightly different when it is moved somewhere else, this messes with my script which tries to use images to compare whats on-screen as they arent allways in the same places.

4. Aspect ratio will impact the scripts functionality so leave it at auto unless otherwise specified.

5. Some users have reported that maxing out the safezone has solved their issues, so if you're having problems give that a try.
